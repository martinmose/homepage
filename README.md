# Martin Mose's Personal Homepage

## Overview

A fun, terminal-style personal homepage hosted on [martinmose.com](http://martinmose.com). Inspired by my love for Vim (Neovim) and all things terminal, this site creates an engaging interface that mimics a command-line environment.

## Commands to Implement and Features

- **help**  
  Displays a list of available commands. Start here to guide users on what they can do.

- **whoami**  
  Outputs links to social media.

  This command provides a way for users to connect with me.

- **cd**  
  Mimic changing directories. No real directories, just play around with it.

- **ls**  
  List random file names as if they are directory contents. Make it fun by including a mix of plausible file and directory names.

- **clear**  
  Clears the screen. Useful for resetting the terminal view.

- **sudo rm -rf /**  
  Forbidden command. Display a warning message and maybe an Easter egg image. Remind users that this is a joke and not something to be executed in real life.

## Technical Details

- **HTML/CSS/JS**: Keep everything simple with these basic web technologies. No need for heavy frameworks. In the era of less is more.
